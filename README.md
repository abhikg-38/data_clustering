# data_clustering
An ML project that employs KMeans, DBSCAN and Guassian mixture models for clustering and drawing inferences from data. For KMeans, evaluation metrics like inertia are analyzed for optimal fit. Relavant hyperparameters are experimented with. To find optimal number of clusters to be defined, silhouette score is measured for the entire dataset. Concept of label propogation is explored in case of semi supervised learning and accuracy scores are compared. Image segmentation is done "artwork3.PNG" to find colour clusters.

DBSCAN is employed to visualize core instances as well as anomaly points of the dataset, optimal value of eps hyperparameter is found. The principle of Gaussian Mixture Models is also explored.
